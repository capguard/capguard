            <h1>The Hidden History of the Tomato 🍅</h1>
            <p><strong>By Sarah Jenkins</strong> | <em>January 4, 2026</em></p>

            <p>The tomato is the edible berry of the plant <em>Solanum lycopersicum</em>, commonly known as the tomato
                plant. It originated in western South America and Central America.</p>

            <h2>Origins and Discovery 🌍</h2>
            <p>Although widely associated with Italian cuisine today, the tomato was actually cultivated by the Aztecs
                and Incas as early as 700 AD. When Spanish conquistadors brought the fruit back to Europe, it was
                initially met with suspicion.</p>

            <blockquote class="highlight">
                "For nearly 200 years, many Europeans believed the tomato was poisonous, referring to it as the 'Poison
                Apple' because aristocrats often got sick after eating them."
            </blockquote>

            <p>Tomatoes are rich in Vitamin C and Lycopene, making them a staple in healthy diets worldwide.</p>
